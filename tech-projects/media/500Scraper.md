## About The Project

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmz97/chengmingzhang.com/master/tech-projects/media/readmeMedia/cmd.gif" alt="about the project">


### Built With

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Selenium Python
```sh
pip install selenium
```

* geckodriver

[Get latest releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

_Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure it’s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH._

* Python Image Library
```sh
pip install Pillow
```


### Installation

1. Clone the Multi-Thread-500px-Scraper

git clone https://github.com/cmz97/Multi-Thread-500px-Scraper.git

## Usage
```sh
  python3 ./500pxScraperParallelProcess 'kordan'
```
This will download all the picture from user ```kordan``` to directory ```./kordan```. In which there is two folder named ```./kordan/nsfw``` for image that is NSFW and ```./kordan/sfw``` for image that is SFW

The program has only one required input, ```USERNAME```, which is the exact username of your target on 500px.
